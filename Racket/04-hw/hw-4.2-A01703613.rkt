    hailstone: The function takes an initial integer as argument,
    and will generate a list of numbers, starting at the number provided and finishing at 1.
    The numbers in between are obtained and added to the list as follows:
    If the number is even, divide it by 2
    If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1

|#

;Receiving an initial int number
(define (hailstone number)
  (let loop
    ;Declaring initial values
    ([value number] [result empty])
    ;Checking if the initial number is zero
    (if (= value 0) result
        ;Checking if a list is not created
        (if (empty? result)
            ;Creating a list with the number as a initial value
            (loop value (list (append result value)))
            ;Verifying the end loop
            (if (= value 1) result
                ;Checking if the next value on the list is odd or even
                (if (even? value)
                    ;Even
                    (loop (/ value 2) (append result (list (/ value 2))))
                    ;Odd
                    (loop (+ (* value 3) 1) (append result (list (+ (* value 3) 1))))

    hailstone-list: The function takes two integers, one lower limit, and an upper limit.
    It will generate a new list with the results of the hailstone function from the lower to the upper limits.
|#


;Receiving lower and upper limits
(define (hailstone-list low-limit up-limit)
  (let loop
    ;Start from lower limit
    ([a low-limit] [result-value empty])
    ;In case has not reached the upper
    (if (<= a up-limit)
        ;Creating lists by using hailstone function from exercise one
        (loop (+ a 1) (append result-value (list (hailstone a))))
        result-value
        )
    )
 )

   shift-char: Takes a character and an integer. If the character is a letter, either lowercase or uppercase,
   it will change the character for the one at the distance indicated by the integer.
   Other characters different from letters will be left as they are.
   The integer can be positive, negative or zero. It should wrap around the letters in the English alphabet.
   The existing functions char->integer and integer->char can help here.
   This function does not need to use lists, but will be necessary for the next function.

   caesar-encode: Takes a string,  an integer and a boolean.
   If the boolean value is false, the function will encode the string by shifting each of its letter characters the distance indicated by the integer.
   If the boolean is true, the function will decode the string, by using the negative of the integer.
   Characters that are not letters should not be changed. The functions string->list and list->string can help.
